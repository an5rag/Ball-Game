# Ball-Game
Ball Game Applet in Java
---------------------------

I had written this applet a few years back, just to play around with my new-found-knowledge about threads and applets in Java. 
It is similar to the snake game, though its much simpler and there is no possibility of looping over yourself (its a BALL!)

Pardon the poor code-style; I'm much better now!

Note:
----
To run the applet, either you'll  have to use a Web Browser or use appletviewer, like I did.
